#### Description:
This final project is a web app built to help my classmates those who are struggling to grasp the concept of programming.
BCA in our college was newly introduced and we are the first batch. And most of my class mates lacked math during their 10+2 since they came from Arts.
Our first year was held online because of the pandemic and a lot of em' got backlogs/retest in discrete math and C programming. I didn't want them lacking behind and since I'm gonna be making a final project for cs50, why not make a website that fill both purpose? Eventuall, I started working on it and leart alot while on it. Now,
This webapp is packed with multiple pdfs, written notes syllabus wise, and links that I think would help them alot. But doing it alone was a stressful thing.
I've added different free online sources where they can learn the fundamentals. Including this Cs50. The main part of this website is the login system built using flask and python which I learnt from this course. Only the "registerants" list in "app.py" will be allowed to access my semster notes that is inside the login page (not the free online resources. I left those freely accessible on the home page).
To login please use: username: vitope password: 12345

Webapp division:
The website is divided into 4 main sections:
Home, Resources, About, Contact.

Version update planning:
Custom chat bot
paid domain

How the webpage works?
It's simple. Just visit https://tetso2022bca.netlify.app/
The web app was hosted using two free services (netlify for homepage and pythonanywhere for the database)
1.Login using username: vitope password: 12345 since I only made it accessible for my classmates and Teachers
2.The login page can be accessed via clicking on "Notes"
3.The rest are materials are only essential for my mates.

Datbase
The database impleted here only stores 3 things. Username, email, and password.
Rest option is not available as of now

Language used:
Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheet, Python, Java Script

Categories:
The source code is categorized into different folder.
The Static folder holds all the Cascading style sheets and source PDFS
The template folder

#### Note: >>This project was completed outside of cs50 IDE/Library with local hosts and database.
